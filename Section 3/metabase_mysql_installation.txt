-- mysql metabase connection -- 
Okay, now is the connection part. We want to connect metabase to database server. 
Let's go to metabase. on the top right, you will see a gear button. 
Click it and choose the admin option and we will come to a setup page. 
Click the add database option and we will be brought to the database setting.
As we can see, there are a lot of database services. 
Let's choose the one that we have installed which is, my sequel. 
For the display name, type in mySQL. For the host, let's type in localhost. 
As we have gone through earlier. localhost mean this machine. 
Okay, for port, we need to type in 3306. 
This is because when we install the my sequel database earlier, we have registered my sequel database service as 3306 in our machine. 
For the database, remember in our earlier chapter, we have created metabase database. now, let's us put metabase as database name here. 
for user name, we can put root, and for the password, I put 1234 for my case. 
Then, click the save and we are good to go. 
if the connection cannot be established, you cannot save it. 
check the database name. Make sure it is the same as what we have created in our database server. it is case sensitive. 
Make sure the password is same as the one that we have setup for the database server.
Make sure the database server is running from the database workbench by typing show databases.
These are all the common mistakes that most people do.
Once, the connection is established. let's us play with it by changing to user mode. let's exit the admin setting.
